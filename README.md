## Agile Planning

### UI Design

## UI Overview

Bookaroo provides an intuitive and responsive interface. Users can:

-   Browse a catalog of books with filtering and sorting options.
-   View detailed book information including authors, stock, and descriptions.
-   Manage reservations through a clear user dashboard.
-   Admins can create, edit, or delete books and authors through structured forms.
-   The layout is consistent across pages, with a shared header, navigation, and footer, and works
    seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### Design Principles

-   **Clean and Modern Layout:** The interface uses a simple and intuitive design, with a consistent
    header, footer, and navigation menu.
-   **Responsive Design:** Implemented with **Bootstrap 5**, adapting to different screen sizes
    (desktop, tablet, mobile).
-   **Consistent Styling:** Colors, fonts, and button styles are consistent across pages for a
    professional look.
-   **Accessibility:** Forms include labels and validation messages; color contrast ensures
    readability.

### Navigation

-   **Header Navigation:** Includes links to Home, Books, Authors, Login/Register, and My
    Reservations (for authenticated users).
-   **Footer:** Contains the brand
-   **Forms:** Book creation, author creation, and reservation forms provide clear instructions and
    feedback.

### Color Palette

Bookaroo‚Äôs design uses a warm, neutral palette that reflects a calm and elegant reading
environment.  
The combination of light backgrounds, brown tones, and muted blues ensures good readability and a
pleasant user experience.

| Color Role               | Hex Code  | Description                              |

## Database

The database schema was designed to efficiently store book information and user data. Django's ORM
ensures consistency and integrity.

## Models

The Bookaroo application has three main models: **Author**, **Book**, and **BookReservation**. These
models handle the core functionality of managing books, authors, and reservations. Below is a
concise overview of their essential fields and relationships.

| Model               | Essential Fields                                 | Relationships / Notes                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Author**          | first_name, last_name, country                   | Many-to-Many with Book. Authors can be soft-deleted without removing associated books.                            |
| **Book**            | title, published_date, stock, is_active          | Many-to-Many with Author. Stock is managed automatically via reservations.                                        |
| **BookReservation** | user (FK), book (FK), days_reserved, reserved_at | Links users to reserved books. Enforces unique active reservation per user & stock management via Django signals. |

**Business Logic Highlights:**

-   Only active authors/books are considered in operations.
-   Users cannot reserve the same book more than once at the same time.
-   Book stock is dynamically updated when reservations are created or canceled.
-   Images are stored in Cloudinary (for book covers).

> Note: Detailed model methods, signals, and constraints are documented in the
> [Models Documentation](https://github.com/RocioSerrano0921/bookaroo/wiki/Models) for developers.

## ü§ñ AI Usage

AI tools, including ChatGPT, were used to:

-   Generate README documentation
-   Draft user stories
-   Improve explanations and descriptions

---

## üöÄ Deployment

### Local Setup

## Local Installation and Configuration

Follow these steps to run **Bookaroo** on your local machine:

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and execute the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RocioSerrano0921/bookaroo.git
cd bookaroo
```

This will download the project into a folder called bookaroo.

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

On macOS:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

-   python3 -m venv venv creates a new virtual environment in a folder called venv.

-   Source venv/bin/activate activates the virtual environment.

-   When activated, your terminal prompt should start with (venv).

### 3. Install Project Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command reads requirements.txt and installs all necessary libraries for Bookaroo.

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a file called .env in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

```bash
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY='your_secret_key_here'
DATABASE_URL='postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/bookaroo'
```

-   Replace 'your_secret_key_here' with a secure, unique secret key.

-   Replace username and password with your PostgreSQL credentials.

-   Important: Never commit your .env file to version control for security reasons.

### 5. # PostgreSQL Setup and Django Integration

Follow these steps to set up your PostgreSQL database via Code Institute and connect it to your
Django project.

---

## 5.1 Access Code Institute PostgreSQL Portal

-   Go to [https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/).
-   Enter your Code Institute LMS email.
-   Create a new database. A unique URL will be generated for your database.
-   Check your email for the management link (acts as your password, keep it safe).

---

## 5.2 Prepare Django Project for PostgreSQL

### Enable Debug Mode

-   Open `codestar/settings.py` and set:

```python
DEBUG = True
```

### Create env.py

-   At the top level of your project:

```python
touch env.py
```

-   Add env.py to .gitignore to prevent sensitive data from being pushed:

```python
env.py
```

-   Add Database URL to env.py

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault(
    "DATABASE_URL", "<your-database-URL>"
)
```

Make sure to include quotes around your URL.

### 5.3 Install Required Packages

```bash
pip3 install dj-database-url~=0.5 psycopg2~=2.9
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

-   psycopg2 ‚Üí PostgreSQL driver for Python.

-   dj-database-url ‚Üí Connect Django to a database via URL.

### 5.4. Connect Django Settings to Environment Variables

-   Open bookaroo/settings.py and add imports:

```python
import os
import dj_database_url

if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
    import env
```

-   Delete the default SQLite3 configuration:

```python
# DATABASES = {
#     'default': {
#         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
#         'NAME': BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
#     }
# }
```

-   Add PostgreSQL connection using the environment variable:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}
```

### 5.5. Apply Django Migrations

python3 manage.py migrate

### 5.6. Create a Superuser

To access the Django admin panel, create a superuser:

```python
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You will be prompted to enter:

Username

Email address

Password

### 5.7. Run the Development Server

Start the local Django development server:

```python
python manage.py runserver
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and visit:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## You should now see the Bookaroo application running locally.

### 5.8. Notes

To deactivate the virtual environment, run:

```bash
deactivate
```

Remember to keep your .env file secure.
